# TechnoCore image
This repo is used as a part of the [TechoCore stack](https://github.com/SciFiFarms/TechnoCore). For more information, checkout TechnoCore's [overview](https://github.com/SciFiFarms/TechnoCore/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#overview).

- These are my notes, links, and instructions on each service. 
- The best way to view the useful docs is to reference the [Overview table](https://github.com/SciFiFarms/TechnoCore/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#overview).
- The docs aren't very usable as a cohesive site. This has been my dumping grounds for all my thoughts for the last year, and thus are in need of some serious reorganization. See https://github.com/SciFiFarms/TechnoCore-Docs/issues/2 for more information.
